             This javascript conditional could introduce bugs because it does not check for types it just checks if it is similar. Ex. We are using the conditional "foo == 'three' ". <br><br>
             If we changed the conditional to check a string number ie. "foo == '3' " this will equal to true even though we have assigned 3 as a number type, not a string type.
             That is because the "==" does not check for type safety which could lead to some potential bug or unintended behavior. So I would change the conditional to use
             the "===" which does check for type safety making sure that a number matches only other numbers and not some string numbers.

            The "deliverable" for this challenge can be as simple as an HTML file with styling in the head, though you can choose to use a preprocessor like Sass, PostCSS, Stylus, or Less and organize the files any way you'd like.

           <p>
 
          <h4> Closure, in computer programming, is an interesting concept about which many people are not quite clear.
Could you please briefly describe, in plain English, what a closure is? <br>
Could you please show and explain to us briefly, with simple code examples (in JavaScript),
how closure can be applied to the following case:<br>
1.  Currying.</h4>
<span class="answer">
A. What is a closure? A closure is a nested function. A function within another function.<br>
         A function that has a main / parent function and a child / secondary function within it.<br>
B. Closure Currying description.</span><br>
<span class="comment">// This is a simple curried function. <br>
// closure is implemented in this function with the separation of the functions arg(a) and arg(b) within the currying function arg(f).</span><br>
<span class="code">function currying(f) { </span> <span class="comment">// this function is doing the transformation of the other two functions</span><br>
    <span class="code">  return function(a) {<br>
    return function(b) { <br>
      return f(a, b);<br>
    };<br>
  };<br>
}<br><br>
</span>
<span class="comment">// here is a simple function using the transformed functioned to multiply two numbers</span><br>
<span class="code">function multiply(a, b) { 
  return a * b;
}

let multiCurry = currying(multiply); </span> <span class="comment">// calling my currying function and including an argument of another function with two more arguments<br><br>

<span class="code">console.log(multiCurry(2)(3));</span> <span class="comment">// result is 6</span><br>
 
<h4>Can you tell us why the following Javascript code doesn‚Äôt work correctly?<br>
How would you fix it?</h4>
</br>
 
 
<span class="comment">/*
This code is a closure that has the main function called count and the anonymous function that console log the counter value after 100ms.
I am assuming that the expected result is for the console log function to print out every element that is traversing through ie. 0, 1, 2 in this case.<br><br>
The reason it does not work properly is because the set timeout function waits for the breakpoint of the for loop which is 3 elements and then proceeds to print them all at once
giving us the entire value that the counter is holding on to on memory which is 3, instead of printing each those values. <br><br>
 
The way to fix this is by moving the delay function out of the for loop so that the breakpoint of the for loop does not interfere with the timeout function delay.
After moving/separating these two we can then include a callback of the timeout function and the counter into the loop for the for loop to know what it is that
it needs to print each time it is traversing through it.
